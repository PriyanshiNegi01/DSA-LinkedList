# Linked List
The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type. The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list.

There are four key types of linked lists:
-  Singly linked lists.
-  Doubly linked lists.
-  Circular linked lists.
-  Circular doubly linked lists.
